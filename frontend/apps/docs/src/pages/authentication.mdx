# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Sonr API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Sonr offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: WebAuthn with a token and Traditional Wallet — WebAuthn is the recommended way.

## MPC with bearer token

The recommended way to authenticate with the Sonr API is by using WebAuthn. When establishing a connection using WebAuthn, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.


## Traditional wallet

With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Unless you have a very good reason, you probably shouldn't use basic auth. Here's how to authenticate using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with basic auth' }}
curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -u username:password
```

Please don't commit your Protocol password to GitHub!

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
