      ServiceRelationship is a relationship between a service and a User entity. This relation
      is used to track the number of times a user has interacted with a service, utilizing a
      verifiable random function (VRF) to generate a random number that is used to determine
      whether or not a user has access to a service.

          key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin
          querying the next page most efficiently. Only one of offset or key
          should be set.
      offset:
        type: string

        description: |-
          offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable.

          be set.
      limit:
        type: string

        description: |-
          limit is the total number of results to be returned in the result page.
          If left empty it will default to a value to be set by each app.
      countTotal:
        type: boolean
        description: |-
          count_total is set to true  to indicate that the result set should include
          a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs.
          count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when key
          is set.
      reverse:
        type: boolean
        description: |-
          reverse is set to true if results are to be returned in the descending order.
